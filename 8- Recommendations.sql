-- RECOMMENDATIONS

-- The assignment in this case was to analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight of the data. Then use this information to give recommendations for a marketing strategy.

-- The first recommendation is to who we are going to direct our marketing strategy. Our data shows us that the users spend in general more than 30 minutes in a physical activity around 41.49% of the days, meaning almost 3 days a week (2.9 days a week). So our marketing strategy should be directed to people that train around 3 times a week for at least 30 minutes.

-- The second recommendation is about when we should try to contact them. Our data shows that the prefered times to excersice are between 17 and 19, 12 and 14 and then from 8 to 11. So I believe that it would be better to contact them if posible sometime outside of the ranges outside of the previous times, because they will be training.
